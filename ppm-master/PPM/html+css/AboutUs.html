            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>We consider that all those affected by eating disorders and issues, including family, friends, parents,
                and support professionals, should have access to resources.</p>
            <p>Eating disorders are usually about food; rather, sufferers generally utilise food as a coping mechanism
                for underlying emotional issues or, in more serious forms, mental illness.</p>
